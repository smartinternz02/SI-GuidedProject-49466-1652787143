Car Performance Prediction using IBM Watson Machine Learning
Car prediction has been so far a very interesting topic to work on where we implement the machine learning concepts and algorithm to train the model or machine.
The performance analysis of the car is based on the engine type, no of engine cylinders, fuel type, and horsepower, etc. These are the factors on which the health of the car can be predicted. It is an on-going process of obtaining, researching, analyzing, and recording the health based on the above three factors. The performance objectives like mileage, dependability, flexibility, and cost can be grouped together to play a vital role in the prediction engine and engine management system. This approach is a very i
Here we train our models to predict the values on the basis of which the model makes the prediction. 
This kind of machine learning is known as supervised machine learning in which on the basis of the given inputs we can get the solution.
For the same we went through various processes:
Project Work Flow:

      1.   Data Collection

      2.   Data Pre-processing

      3.   Model Building

      4.   Application Building
and at the end of that we get our trained model on the basis of which we can make further predictions.These predictions may have some error and may not be very accurate
but its pretty close to the orignal values.
for better understanding of this project we are  providing a demonstration link here:
